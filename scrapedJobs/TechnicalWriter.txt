As a result, we need to document every product and process to date. To solve this problem, we need a Technical Writer that wants to join our team on a short-term contract and be open to ongoing opportunities with us.   What We’re Looking For   We are seeking a Technical Writer with 3-5 years of experience writing API and SDK documents for a rapidly growing software company. Someone with a thirst for exposure. Someone who wants to work from home 40% of the time; and in office with a group of fun-loving, ground-breaking, teams. We want a Technical Writer who is organized and excited to join a hard working team during an exciting growth phase. This role is an integral part of the Jibestream Product Development team. This is a role for someone who can talk the Developer talk and walk the Developer walk. Someone who knows their way around technology. A Technical Writer who understands the difference between writing an end-user manual and a software developer kit (SDK). A Technical Writer who is looking for a short-term full time contract at an exciting company; with the potential for ongoing part-time writing over the long-term.      What you’ll do:   Collaborate. You will partner with our Product Team to document the details and craft the overview of new and existing offerings.   Interview. You will gather information around existing software by interviewing key technical resources.   Create. You will create and maintain SDK and API documentation.   Infuse enthusiasm.

You can work on several projects concurrently; meeting every deadline and exceeding expectations.   Initiative. You recognize gaps in process or detail and you show initiative to suggest solutions.   Here are the top 3 skills that we believe will enable you to succeed:   Autonomous: you should be able to manage your own tasks, under the guidance of our Product Team. You’ll also need to both plan and communicate your upcoming tasks to the rest of the team, and then the ability to execute on them as well.   Thirst for Knowledge: you must be the personality type that is always looking for ways to improve your skills.

It’s a very challenging environment but you will definitely leave Jibestream with some new skills and great experiences.   What’s the downside?   We are pretty self-aware as a company and know the points where we can do better…here they are:   Tough challenges ahead: We are in the process of transitioning from a company delivering a lot of Professional Services to a Product company. Let’s face it, it’s easier to sell when you can tell the customer that each job can be customized to suit their exact needs. We now have a robust and scalable platform that has defined features and functionality and we are very disciplined on what changes get made to the platform. This is the key to our success and our ability to scale but there will be short-term challenges in making this transition. We are revisiting everything from marketing collaterals, pricing, and the GTM plan - and calibrating it all to sync up with the strategy. That is a lot to do in a short period of time!   Process: The Company is growing really fast in all aspects, which is great. The hard part is that we don’t have the process of a big company in place yet. We are counting on our people to help create that process and adjust quickly as we grow.   Join us   If you are awesome and want to join a larger group of awesome people, please apply. We can’t promise it will be a fit but we do promise to consider your creds. We're growing quickly and you never know when the next opportunity will come up so follow us on Twitter @Jibestream or check out our careers page.
