Sensibill is lighting up the FinTech industry with mobile solutions that are changing the way people interact with their own money and enabling corporations to make critical insights. We need a Senior Automation and Manual Quality Assurance Analyst to help us improve our solutions. We want someone who wants to dig in and get their hands dirty implementing Automation Frameworks and running Automation testing. We need someone with Agile experience: we are turning around code and solutions at an incredible pace and we don’t have a fistful of BAs to vet the requirements through. This is all on you! Can you take the pressure and the challenge? We guarantee it will be worth your commitment!   We also need you to actually get your hands dirty. As a company we have developed a habit of picking up discarded receipts from countertops, cashier lines, and yes, the sidewalk. We need tons of test data and there’s no better way to get it. So come on, pick up a #streetreceipt and bring it our way.   Our new Senior (Automation) QA Analyst is going to shape and customize this role. Here’s how:   Create and execute test cases in-line with bi-weekly sprints.   Generate and improve an automated test suite and framework.   Continuously implement and improve on QA processes and automation.   Execute test cases against different platforms using web browsers and mobile devices. Testing shall be primarily focused on user experience, product, and integrations.   Build this role and eventually a team. You pick the tools, the techniques, and the setup!   Be flexible and enjoy working in a start-up culture.   Augment the documentation process and ensure completeness of requirements when they are insufficient using your proven ability to analyze requirements.   Actively contribute to Agile sprints, performing spontaneous or planned test scenarios to support user stories.   Capitalize on your hands-on knowledge of, and experience with, the tools and techniques for implementing, automating, and executing test plans and cases. In particular, expert knowledge of a tool such as Selenium, SoapUI, JMeter would be a strong asset.   So who are you?   An insightful techie. You are an engineer or a programmer; a BA or a technical wizard who understands the ins and outs, ups and downs of requirements and functionality.   A perfectionist. Nothing gets past you. It’s perfection or bust. And in FinTech there is no place this is more important.   A destructor. You enjoy breaking down the product – in order to pinpoint the gaps and faults. You easily recognize gaps and take the initiative to suggest solutions for them.   A team player. You don’t just hand over the bug report; you have solutions.   A communicator. You know how to convey findings, messages, suggestions, and opinions.   A tester. You love the meticulous nature of going through every aspect of a product, every line of code, to ensure we are only releasing the best.   A student. You are constantly learning. On your own. At home. At work. With your teammates. At Meetups.   A teacher. You are bursting with information and knowledge. You can’t help but share the love, and the skills.   A champion. You know the value of the work you do and the importance of QA. You appreciate the hardwork of your team members. You are passionate about working with a company that only delivers the best solutions and you want to be part of that.   An analyst. You enjoy the hands-on, heads-down work of completing major deliverables using formal QA methodologies and disciplines for delivering new or enhanced applications      What you have:   A university degree and all of the soft skills that come with that: communication, documentation, research, analysis, and presentation skills.‬‬‬‬   An obsession with accuracy and processes.   A mirror to ensure that the user story is being reflected in the requirements and vice versa.   Fantastic instincts that point you in the direction of what can go wrong; an innate sense of the technical “gotchas” around security and edge cases.   An impressive level of hands-on expertise in reviewing, designing, creating, and executing ad hoc, exploratory, regression and automation testing.   What are the three greatest things about Sensibill; outside of our incredible financial technology solution? We love pie. We are fun. We are guided by conscientiousness.   Our culture is like that perfect piece of pie. Not a braggart like a fancy- pants cake; that looks better than it tastes. But, humble and delivers exactly what you expect. Why pie? Because that’s our acronym. We are all about passion, integrity, excellence.   We like to have fun, and share the love. So for your birthday, we will treat you to a your favourite pie. Actually, we get a few of them so we can celebrate together.   Why should you join Sensibill?   Joining a start-up in the early days is pretty much the greatest adventure you can go on. We are lean, we are smart, we are fun, and we live for balance – there are no mandatory 60-hour weeks here.   This is not a top-down culture. We want everyone’s input during critical decisions.‬‬‬‬ To that end, if you have ideas, we want to hear them. If you see something that needs doing, we want you to do it. Together we can build out and shape not just your role and your team, but our company. There is an opportunity here.   We want new core team members who want to invest in us the way we invest in them. We want your ideas, your energy, your skills, your dedication, and if you have any, we’ll take your #streetreceipts too.   Sensibill welcomes and encourages applications from people with disabilities. Accommodations are available on request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the selection process.
