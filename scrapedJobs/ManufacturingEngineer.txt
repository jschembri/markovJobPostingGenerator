About ADM      For more than a century, the people of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) have transformed crops into products that serve the vital needs of a growing world. Today, we’re one of the world’s largest agricultural processors and food ingredient providers, with more than 33,000 employees serving customers in more than 140 countries.

Learn more at www.adm.com .      Job Title: Production Engineer – Candiac, Quebec, Canada   Full-Time Exempt Position      The typical career path for an engineer begins in the position of Production Engineer. This position provides an opportunity for new engineers to join the plant management team, starting in wheat flour milling, wet starch processing or other cereal grain milling facilities. All Production Engineers will enter into the STEP program designed to achieve various technical skills that will improve advancement opportunities and lead to continuous process improvements.      Recent engineering graduates are assigned to a production unit where they gain first hand exposure to leadership of employees, equipment trouble-shooting and dealing with the myriad of challenges faced routinely in a facility that operates around the clock, 365 days per year. The experience begins with on- the-job training through observation and typically progresses to full responsibility for a work group working rotating shifts during the first year. This experience is invaluable in providing firsthand knowledge of the plant, processes, products and employees in the real world of manufacturing at ADM. Some of the ADM Milling plants are Union facilities, where Production Engineers also gain experience dealing with labor contract issues.      Specifics      The Production Engineer opportunity is comprised of three primary components; management exposure, supervisory responsibility, and application of engineering expertise.      Early in their assignment, Production Engineers have an opportunity to be exposed to a number of members of management in action. As they rotate through multiple production units to become familiar with the operation, they see different members of the management team using their leadership styles to address various situations. Production Engineers also gain an appreciation for keeping an eye on the “big picture” (present and future of the overall operation and company) while addressing individual issues. After being assigned to lead a work group of their own, they have an opportunity to apply their own leadership approach to interface with employees and management to accomplish the work of the unit. For this position fluency in both French and English is required.      Within a matter of months Production Engineers are assigned to supervise a work group of hourly employees who operate a production unit on shift. In this assignment they will likely work rotating shifts, so during this period they need to be willing to work any hours of the day and on weekends and holidays.      Responsibilities include assuring that 1) the jobs on the shift are covered, 2) employees are adequately trained to perform their assigned work, 3) all work is performed in keeping with the ADM Safety culture, and 4) customer needs are met through production of a high volume of quality products. They also maintain records, deal with employee performance issues (if any) and monitor the production process to keep it running efficiently, consistent with plant operating needs.      Production Engineers apply their engineering expertise to monitor production processes and equipment, solve production problems, and provide input to process improvements. Involvement might include product extraction improvements, mill optimization that may include reflow, sizing of equipment and automation. They are exposed to installation of new equipment and modification of existing equipment, along with all of the inherent training and start up issues that must be addressed.      The work is in a variety of plant settings in food processing plants. The job is physically demanding. Production Engineers must be capable of climbing ladders, riding a belt lift, working in tight spaces and entering confined spaces (including tanks and vessels). Some lifting is required.      Future Assignments      Production Engineer experience provides an outstanding foundation on which to build a career. After a year or so as a Production Engineer, employees with a good understanding of the process could be managing projects and overseeing a department. These assignments involve increasing responsibility and the rewards that go along with it. Opportunities may involve transfer to various locations in the company, so it’s important to be open to relocation, including international opportunities for those that are qualified and so inclined.      ADM offers a bright future and tremendous opportunity for talented individuals who are ready to join the team and make a contribution to our dynamic business.      Successful candidates will be graduating with a B.S. in Mechanical or Agriculture Engineering and preferably with a GPA of 2.8 or greater. Fluency in English and French is required for this position.   This position offers relocation assistance and a complete benefit package, including retirement, health, life, vision and dental insurance.   ADM is committed to Employment Equity and is an Equal Opportunity Employer, requiring the successful completion of a pre-employment medical and reference check.      Ref ID   #LI-POST
