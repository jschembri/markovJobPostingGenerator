Right now, somewhere out there, countless journalists, editors, analysts and influencers are sitting at their desks just waiting to read yet another generic pitch email. From yet another “disruptive” startup that wants to change the world. So they can write glowing 5000-word features about why it’s the best thing ever. OR NOT!      Ready for some real talk? The media world doesn’t work like this anymore, so why does every PR agency act like it does? Shallow, half-baked pitches. Total lack of transparency. Zero accountability. We’re so over it. And we’re not looking back.      We're going to stop wasting money on PR firms.

But we still have a long way to go before advocate marketing is a critical piece of every company’s marketing strategy, team and technology stack.      We have many of the key pieces already in place: advocates singing our praises ( https://www.g2crowd.com/products/influitive-advocatehub/details ), a steady stream of content ( http://influitive.com/blog/ ), sophisticated demand generation processes ( http://influitive.com/blog/how-we-used-account-based- marketing-to-target-our-top-prospects-at-dreamforce/ ) and awesome events ( http://www.advocamp.com/ ). But we’re missing out on tons of opportunities to reach marketers where they’re already learning about the latest and greatest trends, strategies, thought leadership and best practices.

From print ads to websites to tweets, banners, Facebook, video scripts and beyond; you’ve written it all… and can do it in dozens of voices. You can work with designers, art directors and even UX folks to dig into a creative brief and turn insight into a creative spark that fuels an entire campaign.      At Noise, you’ll be a key part of the creative team coming up with big ideas and all the bits and pieces that make it tick.
